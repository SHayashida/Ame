# Ame — Rain on Concrete

A generative art piece that mimics the quiet, cyclical beauty of nature: rain soaking into concrete, spreading, and evaporating under unseen heat. Observed from above, each droplet darkens the surface on impact, diffusing through invisible micro-channels until the slab is fully saturated. Then the rain begins to dance—an endless, meditative rhythm inviting you to watch without thought.

## Concept

*Ame* explores the poetics of natural process through computational simulation. Rain is ephemeral, concrete inert—yet together they create a living surface that breathes. The piece slows time, amplifying overlooked transitions: the fleeting darkness of wetness, the subtle creep of capillary flow, the slow fade as heat reclaims the stone. By isolating and magnifying these quiet phenomena, *Ame* offers a space for contemplation—a digital haiku that asks us to simply be present and observe.
